# The OGP Manifesto: Let's Grow a Solarpunk Future Together

## A Call to Cultivate Change

In a world where agricultural technology increasingly serves the interests of large corporations rather than communities, where knowledge is enclosed rather than shared, and where small farmers struggle against systemic disadvantages, we're building a different path forward—and we need your help.

The Open Growing Protocol (OGP) isn't just a technical specification—it's a movement to democratize growing technology, empower communities, and cultivate a more just and sustainable world. And it's a journey we're inviting you to join.

## What OGP Makes Possible

OGP creates concrete, practical tools that change how we grow:

- **A small farmer in Brazil** can use precision growing techniques previously only available to large agribusinesses, optimizing resource use while maintaining independence
- **A cannabis grower in California** can share their exact growing recipe with someone in Michigan, with the system automatically adapting to different hardware and climate conditions
- **A community garden in an urban food desert** can deploy affordable sensors and automation, sharing a single water source efficiently among multiple plots
- **An indigenous community** can document traditional growing knowledge in a format that preserves its integrity while making it accessible to future generations
- **A network of hobbyist growers** can collectively improve cultivation techniques through shared data and experiments, with attribution that respects each contributor

These aren't just aspirations—they're made possible by OGP's technical capabilities:

- **Recipe Portability**: Define growing recipes once, deploy them anywhere, with the system handling hardware differences
- **Hardware Interoperability**: Mix and match sensors and actuators from different manufacturers, breaking vendor lock-in
- **Progressive Automation**: Start with basic manual growing with recipe guidance, then gradually add automation as resources allow
- **Knowledge Commons**: Share growing methodologies in standardized formats with proper attribution and respect for origins
- **Appropriate Technology**: Deploy on hardware ranging from Raspberry Pis to industrial controllers, with graceful degradation for resource constraints
- **Community Governance**: Participate in transparent, inclusive decision-making that prevents capture by any single entity

## Our Principles in Action

### 1. Technology Should Serve People and Planet

We're building systems that distribute power, enhance community resilience, and regenerate ecosystems. Join us in creating technology that's judged not merely by its sophistication but by how it improves lives and ecosystems.

**Take Action**: Help develop low-cost sensor alternatives, contribute to the appropriate technology guidelines, or test OGP implementations in resource-constrained environments.

### 2. Knowledge Belongs in the Commons

Growing knowledge—whether developed by traditional farmers over generations or by specialized communities like cannabis cultivators—belongs in the commons. Help us create systems for sharing and improving growing methodologies while ensuring proper attribution and respect.

**Take Action**: Document your growing techniques using OGP recipe formats, contribute to translation efforts, or help develop attribution mechanisms that respect diverse knowledge traditions.

### 3. Appropriate Technology Over Needless Complexity

We prioritize solutions that are appropriate to their context. Join us in building systems that can be implemented with minimal resources while scaling to more advanced capabilities when available.

**Take Action**: Develop implementations for single-board computers, create offline-capable interfaces, or document DIY approaches to OGP-compatible hardware.

### 4. Decentralization and Resilience

Centralized systems are vulnerable to disruption and control. Help us design for distributed resilience—systems that function without central coordination and maintain local autonomy.

**Take Action**: Contribute to mesh networking capabilities, develop offline synchronization mechanisms, or create local-first implementations of OGP components.

### 5. Ecological Integration

True sustainability requires growing systems that work with rather than against natural processes. Join us in promoting energy-efficient techniques and biodiversity-supporting methods.

**Take Action**: Develop energy usage monitoring, contribute to closed-loop system designs, or create growing recipes that enhance soil health and biodiversity.

## Join Us on This Journey

### Developers and Makers

Your skills are crucial to making this vision real. Whether you're a hardware hacker, a software engineer, or a UX designer, there's a place for you in building the tools that will democratize growing technology.

We need your help creating reference implementations, developing user interfaces that work across literacy and resource levels, and building the infrastructure for a truly open growing ecosystem.

### Growers and Farmers

Your knowledge and experience are the foundation of everything we do. Whether you're a commercial farmer, a cannabis cultivator, or a backyard gardener, your insights drive OGP's development.

Share your techniques in a format that gives you proper credit, test early implementations and provide feedback, or simply tell us what you need from technology to make your growing more sustainable and successful.

### Community Organizers and Educators

Your ability to connect people and share knowledge is essential to OGP's adoption. Help us build learning communities, develop educational resources, and ensure that this technology reaches those who need it most.

Organize workshops in your community, develop curriculum around OGP, or help us understand how to better serve underrepresented growing communities.

### Researchers and Students

Your curiosity and methodical approach help us improve and validate OGP. Design experiments to test growing methodologies, analyze data from community implementations, or develop new applications of the protocol.

## Getting Started

Ready to join the movement? Here are some concrete first steps:

1. **Explore the Protocol**: Read through the [specifications](https://github.com/opengrowingalliance/specifications/blob/main/v2.0/ogsp-root-spec.md) to understand OGSP's capabilities
2. **Join the Community**: Introduce yourself on the [forum](https://github.com/orgs/opengrowingalliance/discussions) and find others with similar interests
3. **Start Small**: Try implementing a simple OGSP recipe for a plant you're already growing
4. **Share Your Experience**: Document your journey and share it with the community
5. **Find Your Niche**: Join a working group that matches your skills and interests

### Beginner-Friendly Projects

- **Recipe Documentation**: Convert an existing growing guide to OGP format
- **Sensor Integration**: Connect a simple temperature sensor to an OGP system
- **Translation**: Help translate core documentation into your language
- **Testing**: Test existing implementations and provide feedback
- **Community Building**: Organize a local meetup to introduce OGP

## The Future We're Building Together

The OGP isn't just a protocol—it's a community working toward a more just, sustainable, and abundant future. Whether you're a farmer, a grower, a developer, a maker, or simply someone who shares our vision, there's a place for you in this movement.

Together, we can cultivate not just plants, but a better world—one where technology serves people and planet, knowledge flows freely, and communities thrive in harmony with nature.

This isn't a distant utopia—it's a future we're actively building, one commit, one recipe, one garden at a time. And we need your hands, your mind, and your heart to make it real.

Will you join us?
