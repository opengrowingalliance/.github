# The OGSP Manifesto: Growing a Solarpunk Future

## A Call to Cultivate Change

In a world where agricultural technology increasingly serves the interests of large corporations rather than communities, where knowledge is enclosed rather than shared, and where small farmers struggle against systemic disadvantages, we propose a different path forward.

The Open Growing System Protocol (OGSP) is more than a technical specification—it is a movement to democratize growing technology, empower communities, and cultivate a more just and sustainable world.

## Our Vision

We envision a solarpunk future where:

- Advanced growing technology is accessible to everyone, from small-scale farmers to community growers
- Traditional wisdom and modern innovation combine to create resilient, sustainable growing systems
- Communities control their own food and plant cultivation systems
- Technology serves ecological sustainability, social justice, and community empowerment
- Small farmers can compete with large agribusinesses on a more level playing field
- Knowledge flows freely, with proper attribution and respect for its origins
- Growing systems work with rather than against natural processes

## Our Principles

### 1. Technology Should Serve People and Planet

We reject the notion that technology must inevitably concentrate power and wealth. Instead, we design systems that distribute power, enhance community resilience, and regenerate ecosystems. Our technology is judged not merely by its technical sophistication but by how it improves lives and ecosystems.

### 2. Knowledge Belongs in the Commons

Growing knowledge—whether developed by traditional farmers over generations or by specialized communities like cannabis cultivators—belongs in the commons, not locked behind proprietary barriers. We create systems for sharing and improving growing methodologies while ensuring proper attribution and respect.

### 3. Appropriate Technology Over Needless Complexity

We prioritize solutions that are appropriate to their context—simple where simplicity serves, sophisticated where complexity is needed. Our systems can be implemented with minimal resources while scaling to more advanced capabilities when available.

### 4. Decentralization and Resilience

Centralized systems are vulnerable to disruption and control. We design for distributed resilience—systems that function without central coordination, degrade gracefully under resource constraints, and maintain local autonomy with optional connectivity.

### 5. Ecological Integration

True sustainability requires growing systems that work with rather than against natural processes. We promote energy-efficient techniques, closed-loop approaches, and biodiversity-supporting methods that enhance rather than deplete ecosystems.

### 6. Economic Justice

Technology should help rebalance power dynamics, not reinforce them. We actively work to create tools that help small farmers and community growers compete with large-scale industrial agriculture, supporting economic justice and local sovereignty.

### 7. Community Governance

The protocol evolves through community-driven processes with clear governance structures that represent diverse stakeholder interests, prevent capture by any single entity, and provide clear paths for participation.

## Our Commitments

### To Small Farmers and Community Growers

We commit to creating technology that meets your actual needs, not what we think you need. Our specifications will always include provisions for low-cost implementations, appropriate technology adaptations, and offline operation. Your knowledge and experience are valued and respected.

### To Specialized Growing Communities

We recognize the sophisticated knowledge developed by communities like cannabis cultivators. We commit to creating platforms for documenting and sharing your techniques while respecting your independence and the unique context of your work.

### To Traditional Knowledge Holders

We acknowledge that growing wisdom has been developed over generations by communities worldwide. We commit to creating systems that preserve and enhance this knowledge rather than replacing or exploiting it, with mechanisms for proper attribution and respect.

### To Open Source Developers

We commit to clear specifications, comprehensive documentation, and a welcoming community. Our work will always remain open, with transparent governance and decision-making processes.

### To Hardware Manufacturers

We commit to stable interfaces, clear versioning, and backward compatibility guidelines. We encourage innovation while maintaining interoperability across the ecosystem.

## Join Us

The OGSP is not just a protocol—it's a community working toward a more just, sustainable, and abundant future. Whether you're a farmer, a grower, a developer, a maker, or simply someone who shares our vision, there's a place for you in this movement.

Together, we can cultivate not just plants, but a better world—one where technology serves people and planet, knowledge flows freely, and communities thrive in harmony with nature.
